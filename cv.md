## ABOUT MYSELF
My goal at the moment is to become a *front-end engineer*. My priorities in my work are **accuracy**, **punctuality** and **strict implementation of the task**. My strengths are **dedication**, **learning** and **constant striving to improve my own knowledge and skills**. At the moment I have no experience in the field of front-end development, but my desire to learn and improve **will give a head start to everyone**.
